                <p class="about-details">
                React Native, Swift & Objective-C <br /> <br/>
                A passionate react native developer, I switched to freelancing from my full-time job as currently, I am a post graduation student at Lambton College in the Mobile application design and development course.

                I have over 3+ years of experience in mobile application development for iOS and Android platforms. I have advanced knowledge of React native as well as Swift language.
                
                As a freelancer, I have worked with numerous entrepreneurs and created multiple applications with higher ratings on the Play store and App Store. All the applications are with a great user experience and performance.
                
                I am very efficient and can create high-performance applications in given timelines. I have also demonstrated the ability in creating API and handling databases with Firebase framework.
